# Research: Game Management System

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Feature**: Game Management System
**Branch**: 002-game-management-specify

## Technical Decisions

### Database Schema Extensions

**Decision**: Extend existing tables with minimal additions rather than creating new schemas
**Rationale**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-player functionality while adding required multi-user host features
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate host-specific database schema (rejected: unnecessary complexity)
- Complete schema redesign (rejected: breaks existing functionality)

**Required additions**:
- `user_profiles.preferred_role` (varchar) - Persistent host/player preference
- `games.archived` (boolean) - Soft delete for game archival
- `games.self_registration_enabled` (boolean) - Team registration toggle
- `games.min_players_per_team` (integer) - Team size constraint
- `rounds.custom_categories` (jsonb) - Per-round category overrides

### Question Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Enhanced question selection with duplicate tracking and category fallback
**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for hosts while maintaining question quality and preventing repetition
**Alternatives considered**:
- Strict no-duplicate policy (rejected: limits host flexibility for specialized events)
- Random selection without tracking (rejected: poor user experience with repeated questions)

**Implementation approach**:
- Leverage existing `host_used_questions` table for duplicate tracking
- Allow duplicates with clear warnings when insufficient unique questions available
- Category expansion algorithm for insufficient question scenarios

### User Role Persistence

**Decision**: Store role preference in user profile with session-based override capability
**Rationale**: Balances user convenience with flexibility for users who switch between roles
**Alternatives considered**:
- Session-only storage (rejected: poor UX requiring repeated selection)
- Permanent role assignment (rejected: limits user flexibility)

**Implementation approach**:
- Add `preferred_role` field to user profiles
- Default dashboard route based on preference
- Role switcher in navigation for session overrides

### Real-time Synchronization Architecture

**Decision**: Supabase Realtime channels for host-player coordination during game management
**Rationale**: Enables live updates for team registration and game configuration changes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Polling-based updates (rejected: poor performance and user experience)
- WebSocket implementation (rejected: unnecessary complexity when Supabase Realtime available)

**Implementation approach**:
- Game-specific channels for configuration updates
- Team registration events for self-registration scenarios
- Optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation

### Component Architecture Strategy

**Decision**: Extend existing component patterns with new host-specific component tree
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with established design system while providing specialized host interfaces
**Alternatives considered**:
- Modify existing components for dual-purpose use (rejected: increases complexity)
- Separate admin interface (rejected: creates maintenance overhead)

**New component structure**:
```
src/components/host/
├── dashboard/           # Host dashboard and game overview
├── game-management/     # Game CRUD operations
├── round-management/    # Round and question configuration
├── team-management/     # Team setup and player assignment
└── shared/             # Reusable host-specific components
```

### State Management Pattern

**Decision**: Extend existing GameContext with host-specific state and actions
**Rationale**: Leverages established patterns while providing specialized state management for host operations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate HostContext (rejected: unnecessary state duplication)
- Global state management library (rejected: over-engineering for current scope)

**State additions**:
- Host game list with filtering/sorting
- Game configuration wizard state
- Question preview and replacement state
- Team management state

## Technology Integration

### Supabase RLS Policies

**Decision**: Extend existing RLS policies with host-specific access patterns
**Rationale**: Maintains security while enabling host management capabilities
**Implementation**: Add host-specific policies for game modification, team management, and question access

### Form Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Zod schema validation with React Hook Form integration
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing patterns, provides type safety and validation consistency
**Implementation**: Define schemas for game configuration, team setup, and question management forms

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive test coverage following TDD principles with host-specific test scenarios
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for test-driven development
**Approach**:
- Contract tests for all new service methods
- Integration tests for complete host workflows
- Unit tests for component logic and state management
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization

**Decision**: Lazy loading for host-specific features with code splitting
**Rationale**: Maintains performance for player-only users while providing full host functionality
**Implementation**: Route-based code splitting for host dashboard and management interfaces

### Database Query Optimization

**Decision**: Efficient query patterns with minimal N+1 scenarios
**Rationale**: Supports scale requirements (100+ concurrent games, 20 teams per game)
**Approach**:
- Batch queries for team and player data
- Indexed queries for game filtering and sorting
- Optimized question selection algorithms

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Control

**Decision**: Comprehensive RLS policies with role-based access control
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for security, ensures proper data isolation
**Implementation**: Host-only access for game management, player access for team operations

### Input Validation

**Decision**: Client and server-side validation with sanitization
**Rationale**: Security best practices for user-generated content
**Implementation**: Zod validation schemas with escape/sanitization for display content
