# Feature Specification: Single-User Trivia Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-project-is`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This project is a single-user trivia game using a Supabase project (currently accessible via the Supabase MCP server). There is an existing \"questions\" table in the supabase database containing trivia questions, possible answers, correct answers, and relevant metadata. The correct answer is always in field a, with plausible but incorrect answers in fields b, c, and d. The simplified game flow should: - Allow the user to start a new game session. - Allow the user to select the number of rounds and the the number of questions for each round. - Allow the user to choose which categories of questions they want to answer (for each round, so one round could be \"Science\" and the next \"History\", or any round can have any combination of categories or use all categories). - Randomly select questions from the \"questions\" table based on the user's preferences to create a question set for the game session. - Select and display questions one at a time from the set of game questions. Answers need to be randomized in their display order, since the correct answer is always in \"a\". - Allow the user to submit an answer for each question. - Check the submitted answer against the correct answer stored in the database. - Track the user's score based on correct answers. - Provide immediate feedback after each question (correct/incorrect). - Continue through each round, providing a score summary at the end of the round. - Include a basic UI flow: start game, show question, show score, and end game. Please inspect the structure of the \"questions\" table to infer relevant fields and use the database for question selection and validation. Exclude multi-user or realtime functionalities for now; focus only on the single-user experience."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clearly described: Single-user trivia game with database integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Single user
   ‚Üí Actions: Start game, configure rounds/questions, select categories, answer questions, view scores
   ‚Üí Data: Questions database with categories, answers, and metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: Single-user only, no realtime/multiplayer features
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All major aspects clearly specified in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: game setup ‚Üí question answering ‚Üí scoring ‚Üí completion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements derived from user description are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Game session, Question, Round, Score entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Client-side data storage approach (localStorage vs IndexedDB)
   - Performance targets and Core Web Vitals requirements
   - Error handling and offline behavior
   - Third-party API integration requirements
   - Accessibility and mobile responsiveness needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a trivia enthusiast, I want to play a customizable single-player trivia game where I can choose the number of rounds, questions per round, and question categories, so that I can enjoy a personalized trivia experience and track my performance across different knowledge domains.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am starting a new game, **When** I configure 3 rounds with 5 questions each and select "Science" and "History" categories, **Then** the system creates a game session with 15 total questions randomly selected from those categories
2. **Given** I am answering a question with 4 possible answers, **When** the question is displayed, **Then** the answer options are shown in randomized order (not always A, B, C, D as stored)
3. **Given** I have answered a question, **When** I submit my answer, **Then** I receive immediate feedback showing whether my answer was correct or incorrect
4. **Given** I have completed all questions in a round, **When** the round ends, **Then** I see a summary showing my score for that round
5. **Given** I have completed all rounds in a game session, **When** the game ends, **Then** I see my overall game statistics and can choose to start a new game

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are insufficient questions in selected categories for the requested number of questions?
- How does the system handle if a user abandons a game session partway through?
- What occurs if the same question is randomly selected multiple times for a single game session?
- How should the system handle resuming a saved game session after interruption?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to start a new game session
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to configure the number of rounds per game with practical upper limit of 100 rounds
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to configure the number of questions per round with practical upper limit of 1000 questions
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to select one or more question categories from available categories in the database
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to select "all categories" as an option for any round
- **FR-006**: System MUST randomly select questions from the database based on user-specified categories and quantities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Round**: A subset of questions within a game session, with its own scoring and summary
- **Question**: Individual trivia question with one correct answer and three incorrect options, belonging to a specific category
- **Score**: Tracking mechanism for correct/incorrect answers at both round and game session levels
