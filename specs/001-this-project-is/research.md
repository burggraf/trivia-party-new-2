# Research: Single-User Trivia Game

## React Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Use React 18+ with functional components and hooks
**Rationale**:
- Modern React pattern with better performance through concurrent features
- Hooks provide cleaner state management and side effects handling
- Better TypeScript integration and developer experience
- Aligns with Shadcn UI component patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- React class components: Deprecated pattern, worse TypeScript support
- Vue.js: Not specified in requirements, different ecosystem
- Vanilla JavaScript: Too complex for this feature set

## State Management Approach

**Decision**: React Context + useReducer for global state, useState for local component state
**Rationale**:
- No complex state management library needed for single-user application
- React Context sufficient for auth state and game session state
- useReducer provides predictable state updates for game logic
- Lightweight approach maintains bundle size goals

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for single-user app, adds bundle size
- Zustand: Good option but adds dependency, Context is sufficient
- React Query: Useful for server state but Supabase client handles caching

## Supabase Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Supabase client SDK with Row Level Security (RLS) policies
**Rationale**:
- RLS ensures user data isolation without server-side logic
- Edge functions for complex game setup logic prevents client-side manipulation
- Real-time subscriptions for future multiplayer expansion
- Built-in auth integration with React

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct PostgreSQL connection: Not possible in static deployment
- REST API wrapper: Unnecessary when Supabase provides type-safe client
- GraphQL: Supabase PostgREST API sufficient for this use case

## UI Component Strategy

**Decision**: Shadcn UI with custom game-specific components
**Rationale**:
- Copy-paste components reduce bundle size vs full UI library
- Tailwind CSS integration provides consistent styling
- Accessible components by default
- Easy customization for game-specific needs (score displays, timers)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavier bundle, different design language
- Chakra UI: Good alternative but Shadcn UI specified in requirements
- Custom components: Too much development time for UI primitives

## Authentication Flow Design

**Decision**: Supabase Auth with email/password and social providers
**Rationale**:
- Handles JWT token management automatically
- Persistent session across browser refreshes
- Social login reduces friction for users
- Integrates with RLS policies seamlessly

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation: Complex and security-risky
- Firebase Auth: Different ecosystem, migration complexity
- Auth0: Adds external dependency and cost

## Data Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Hybrid approach - Supabase for persistent data, localStorage for session state
**Rationale**:
- Game sessions need to persist across page refreshes
- User profiles and game history stored in Supabase
- Question caching in localStorage improves performance
- Offline capability for question answering

**Alternatives considered**:
- All data in Supabase: Slower for temporary game state
- All data in localStorage: No user persistence across devices
- IndexedDB: Overkill for this simple data structure

## Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Code splitting by route + lazy loading for heavy components
**Rationale**:
- Game component only loaded when starting game
- Auth components loaded on demand
- Question database queries paginated and cached
- Bundle analyzer integration for monitoring

**Alternatives considered**:
- No optimization: Would exceed bundle size goals
- Component-level splitting: Too granular, diminishing returns
- Service worker caching: Complex for minimal benefit in this app

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E
**Rationale**:
- Vitest faster than Jest with better ESM support
- React Testing Library encourages testing user behavior
- Playwright provides cross-browser E2E coverage
- Mocking Supabase client for unit tests

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower, more configuration needed
- Cypress: Good but Playwright has better TypeScript support
- Testing without mocking: Flaky tests dependent on external service

## Development Workflow

**Decision**: TypeScript strict mode + ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks
**Rationale**:
- Strict TypeScript catches errors at compile time
- Automated formatting ensures consistency
- Pre-commit hooks prevent bad code from entering repository
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript: Loss of type safety for larger codebase
- Manual formatting: Inconsistent code style
- No pre-commit hooks: Quality issues in repository

## Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Extend existing schema with game_sessions, user_profiles tables
**Rationale**:
- Leverage existing questions table structure
- Add user-specific tables with foreign key relationships
- RLS policies for data isolation
- Minimal schema changes to existing system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Modify questions table: Could break existing data
- Single table design: Poor normalization and query performance
- NoSQL approach: PostgreSQL provides better consistency for game logic
