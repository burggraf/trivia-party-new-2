/plan

Create a detailed implementation plan for a single-user trivia game with the following technology and design requirements:

- Use React for all client-side code; this is a frontend-only application (a static web app with no server-side code).
- Use the Shadcn UI component library for all user interface elements.
- Use Supabase as the backend data source and service provider.
- You can use Supabase edge functions or postgres functions to set up the game if necessary to prevent potential cheating.
- Implement user authentication and registration exclusively using Supabase Auth.
- Ensure the user/playerâ€™s gameplay session is always associated with their Supabase authenticated user account.
- Design and style the UI with a modern, simple look using muted or monochromatic color schemes for a clean, elegant appearance.
- The application should include flows for user registration, login, starting a new game, playing through questions, showing feedback per question, tracking and displaying the score, ending the game, and logout.
- Use the Supabase database, specifically the "questions" table, to fetch and validate trivia questions.  Create and use any other Supabase tables or functions as needed.
- Plan should include components structure, state management approach, handling of authentication state, and necessary API interactions with Supabase.
- Include error handling and loading states for backend requests.
